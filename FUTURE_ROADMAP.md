# 🚀 Future Features & Roadmap

This document tracks planned enhancements and pending features for the Ekbottlebeer Scalper Bot. We will tackle these items one by one to evolve the system from "Operational" to "Advanced".

## 1. Core Infrastructure & Persistence
- [ ] **Database Integration (SQLite)**
    - *Current State*: Trade history and PnL are stored in memory or JSON, which is limited. `/history` is a placeholder.
    - *Goal*: Implement a lightweight SQL database (`trade_history.db`).
    - *Benefits*:
        - Persistent Trade History (survives restarts).
        - Detailed PnL tracking, Win Rate analytics, and Equity Curve plotting.
        - Enable full, real-time functionality for the `/history` command.

- [ ] **VPS / Deployment Hardening**
    - *Current State*: Running locally on Mac.
    - *Goal*: Ensure 24/7 uptime and reliable operation in a server environment.
    - *Tasks*:
        - Migrate to Windows VPS (easiest for MT5) or Linux Server.
        - Ensure "Headless" screenshot generation works reliably (for Auto-Evidence).
        - Setup process manager (e.g., PM2 or Systemd) for auto-restart on crash.

## 2. Risk & Strategy Logic
- [ ] **Full News Protection (Crypto/Bybit)**
    - *Current State*: High-impact news protection (moving SL to Breakeven) is currently implemented for **MT5/Forex** only.
    - *Goal*: Extend `risk.protect_active_trades` in `main.py` to handle Bybit positions.
    - *Tasks*:
        - Iterate through Bybit positions.
        - Check correlation with USD news events.
        - Tighten stops or close positions automatically before NFP/CPI/FOMC.

## 3. Commands & Usability
- [ ] **Smarter `/canceltest`**
    - *Current State*: Command is a placeholder.
    - *Goal*: Allow instant "Undo" for test trades to prevent them from hitting SL/TP accidentally during testing.
    - *Tasks*:
        - Track specific Order IDs generated by the `/test` command.
        - Implement logic to immediately close those specific Order IDs.

- [ ] **Native MT5 Market Order**
    - *Current State*: `/test` uses a limit order at the current price as a workaround for MT5.
    - *Goal*: Add a dedicated `place_market_order` function to `mt5_bridge.py`.
    - *Benefit*: Faster and more reliable execution for immediate entries.

## 4. Advanced Visuals
- [ ] **Web Dashboard (Streamlit)**
    - *Current State*: Console logs and Telegram.
    - *Goal*: Reactivate and connect the Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`).
    - *Benefits*: Visual realtime graph of balance, active trades table, and setting controls via a Web UI.
